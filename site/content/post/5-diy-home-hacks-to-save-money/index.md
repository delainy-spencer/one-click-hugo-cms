Between chasing toddlers and trying to keep the house semi-clean, I’m all about quick, clever hacks that make home life smoother and a little more fun. These five tricks use everyday scraps — dryer lint, candle wax, lemon peels, even coffee grounds — to make your home cleaner, more frugal, and more functional.

## 1. Dryer Lint + Candle Wax Fire Starters  

Don’t toss that dryer lint! Mix it with leftover candle wax for a rustic (and free!) fire starter.  

**How to make it:**  
1. Stuff lint into paper egg carton cups.  
2. Pour melted wax over each.  
3. Let cool, then tear off one section to use at a time.  

These work great in fireplaces, outdoor fire pits, or sauna stoves — they light fast and burn long!  

🧮 **Fire Starter Mix Calculator**  
> Each egg carton cup uses about **1 tablespoon of melted wax.**

## 2. Coffee Grounds Odor Absorber  

Save your used coffee grounds! Dry them and pop a small bowl in your fridge, near the litter box, or by shoes to absorb smells naturally. Bonus: compost them later.

## 3. Lemon Vinegar Cleaner  

Citrus peels + vinegar = a naturally fresh cleaner that actually works.  

**How to make it:**  
- Fill a mason jar with citrus peels.  
- Cover with white vinegar and let it steep for two weeks.  
- Strain and dilute 1:1 with water.  

Use it on counters, sinks, and floors for a fresh, nontoxic clean.  

🧮 **Cleaner Dilution Calculator**  
> Enter your total amount and divide by 2 — half vinegar, half water.

## 4. Candle Wax Drawer Slider  

Sticky wooden drawers? Rub an old candle along the runners — they’ll glide open and closed like new. Works on window tracks too!

## 5. Essential Oil Cotton Ball Air Freshener  

Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil to a cotton ball and tuck it into vents, drawers, or under couch cushions. It’s the simplest, safest way to freshen up the house — and no synthetic sprays needed.
