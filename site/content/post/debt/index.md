Are you tired of juggling multiple debts and not seeing progress fast enough? Choosing the right debt payoff strategy can make a huge difference. Two of the most popular methods are the **Debt Snowball** and the **Debt Avalanche**. But which one is right for you?

## What is the Debt Snowball Method?

The **Debt Snowball** method focuses on **paying off your smallest debts first**, regardless of interest rate. The idea is simple:

1. List all your debts from smallest balance to largest.
2. Make minimum payments on all debts except the smallest.
3. Put any extra money toward the smallest debt until it’s gone.
4. Repeat with the next smallest debt.

**Why it works:**  
- Quick wins keep you motivated.  
- You get psychological momentum by crossing debts off your list.

## What is the Debt Avalanche Method?

The **Debt Avalanche** method focuses on **paying off debts with the highest interest rates first**. Steps:

1. List all debts from highest interest rate to lowest.
2. Make minimum payments on all debts except the one with the highest rate.
3. Put any extra money toward that high-interest debt.
4. Once it’s gone, move to the next highest interest rate.

**Why it works:**  
- Saves you the most money on interest in the long run.  
- Faster overall debt payoff if you can stay disciplined.
