# 10 Real Side Hustles for Stay-at-Home Moms (That Actually Pay!)

The good news? There are real, flexible side hustles you can do from home — no scams, no “$97 course” required. Just legit ways to make money on your own time.

Here are **10 real side hustles for stay-at-home moms** that you can start this week.

## 1. [DataAnnotation.tech](https://www.dataannotation.tech) – Get Paid to Train AI Models

This is one of the *best* legit remote gigs I’ve seen lately.  
**DataAnnotation.tech** pays you to help improve AI models — things like labeling data, checking chatbot responses, or writing sample text.

- **Pay:** $20–$45/hour depending on the task  
- **Requirements:** Strong English, attention to detail, and a laptop (no special tech skills required!)  
- **Why moms love it:** You can work anytime — during naps, after bedtime, or while your toddler is busy with snacks.  

💡 *Tip:* The application can take a bit of time, but once you’re in, the flexibility is unbeatable.

I personally have made hundreds of dollars with the precious few hours I've devoted to the platform.
