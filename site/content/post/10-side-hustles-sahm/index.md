## 1. [DataAnnotation.tech](https://www.dataannotation.tech) – Get Paid to Train AI Models

This is one of the *best* legit remote gigs I’ve seen lately.  
**DataAnnotation.tech** pays you to help improve AI models — things like labeling data, checking chatbot responses, or writing sample text.

- **Pay:** $20–$45/hour depending on the task  
- **Requirements:** Strong English, attention to detail, and a laptop (no special tech skills required!)  
- **Why moms love it:** You can work anytime — during naps, after bedtime, or while your toddler is busy with snacks.  

💡 *Tip:* The application can take a bit of time, but once you’re in, the flexibility is unbeatable.

I personally have made hundreds of dollars with the precious few hours I've devoted to the platform.

## 2. Freelance Writing on [Fiverr](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=1148321&brand=fiverrmarketplace)

If you enjoy writing (and you already write amazing Instagram captions, right?), freelance writing is a natural fit.  
Websites, blogs, and businesses are *constantly* looking for writers.

- **Where to start:** [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/), [Fiverr](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=1148321&brand=fiverrmarketplace), or join Facebook groups for freelance writers.  
- **Pay:** $0.10–$1.00 per word depending on experience.  
- **Mom hack:** Pitch “parenting,” “lifestyle,” or “home organization” blogs — write what you already know!

## 3. Sell on [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace) or [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/)

If you’re already decluttering toys and baby clothes, why not turn it into a hustle?

- **Sell:** Kids’ clothes, gear, home décor, or thrifted finds.  
- **Bonus:** eBay even lets you export sales data to track your progress — super satisfying.  
- **Mom hack:** Keep a “resell bin” in your laundry room for outgrown clothes.

## 4. Become a Virtual Assistant (VA)

Busy business owners need help — and moms are *literally built* for multitasking.  
You can handle emails, schedule posts, manage spreadsheets, and more.

- **Pay:** $20–$40/hour  
- **Where to find gigs:** [Belay](https://www.belaysolutions.com/), [Fancy Hands](https://www.fancyhands.com/), or VA Facebook groups  
- **Why it works:** You can work 5–10 hours a week during quiet moments and scale up when you’re ready.

## 5. Start a Blog or YouTube Channel

Got something you love sharing — mom hacks, cleaning routines, or sourdough bread?  
You can grow an audience and earn income through ads, sponsorships, or affiliate links.

- **Start your blog:** [Host your site with Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) or [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/)  
- **Mom hack:** Film short “day in the life” or “real mom moments” for YouTube Shorts — no fancy editing needed.
- **My favorite tool:** Use Awin to partner with brands and start earning every time somebody clicks your link! [Awin](http://www.awin1.com/)
