Most people *think* they know how much they can save each month — but the truth is, our budgets are full of little leaks. Subscriptions we forget about, impulse Target runs, and drive-thru coffee add up fast.

That’s why I built this simple calculator to give you a **realistic snapshot of your monthly savings potential.**

## 💡 Why It Matters
Your monthly savings rate is the foundation of everything else in personal finance:
- Want to build an emergency fund? You’ll need to know your monthly savings.
- Want to pay off debt faster? Extra savings = extra payments.
- Want to invest? Your savings rate tells you what’s possible.

## ✅ What to Do With Your Result
- **If your savings are positive:** Great! Automate transfers into a high-yield savings account so the money doesn’t “disappear” during the month.  
- **If your savings are zero or negative:** Don’t panic. Start by cutting one small expense (like streaming services or eating out once less per week). Even $50/month adds up.

## 🚀 Takeaway
Knowing your savings number is the first step toward control. Use this calculator every month as your financial check-in. Over time, even tiny improvements compound into big wins.
