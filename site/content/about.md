# Hi, Iâ€™m Delainy!
*A former electrical engineer turned stay-at-home mom who loves a good spreadsheet.*

When I left engineering to raise my kids, I quickly realized that managing a household budget and running a small business both require efficient systems that actually work. My husband runs his own business, and I handle all the **accounting in QuickBooks**, tracking expenses, income, and goals with the same data-driven mindset I used in engineering.  

Over time, I started creating tools and strategies to simplify our **family finances**, **side hustles**, and **small business bookkeeping** â€” and thatâ€™s how *Scrappy Cents* was born.
