1. Reframe the Goal

Passive income from affiliate marketing isn’t really passive in the beginning. It’s like planting a garden—you prep the soil (site setup), plant seeds (content/tools), then wait for growth. The payoff comes later.

Right now you’re in “seed planting” mode.

2. Strip Down the Tech

You don’t need everything fancy right away.

Start with content. Blog posts with affiliate links are the foundation.

Add calculators later (or even just link to a simple hosted version). You can frame them as “bonus tools” without stressing over integration.

If Hugo + Netlify feels clunky, consider a more plug-and-play option like WordPress (with plugins), Ghost, or even Carrd + Gumroad/Notion embeds.

3. Focus on Fast Wins

Make 3–5 solid posts (each with one calculator or downloadable).

Add a simple email opt-in (“Get my free calculator in your inbox”).

Join 1–2 affiliate programs that actually match your content (don’t try to do everything at once).

4. Lean on Templates + Tools

I can make you ready-to-drop-in calculators in plain HTML files—then you just upload them and link/iframe them without touching Hugo’s guts too much.

I can also give you a starter affiliate disclosure, privacy policy, and About page so your site looks legit quickly.

👉 Here’s the mindset shift: You don’t need the “perfect, polished blog with calculators built in.” You just need something live that works. Every post + tool is an asset you can refine over time.

Do you want me to sketch you the minimum viable setup (like “Day 1 version” of your blog that could already make money) so you don’t get bogged down in tech?
